> **Note:** Unsupervised Machine Learning Assignment Submission Deadline: Friday, 22 September 2023, 12:00


This topic includes 5 sessions as follows:

- **Introduction to Unsupervised Machine Learning (Mon, Sep 18th, 08:15-12:00):** This session will introduce the principles and applications of unsupervised machine learning (UML). Students will learn about the different types of UML problems, and they will explore some of the most popular UML algorithms, such as PCA, SVD, and NMF.
- **UML 2: Recommendation & Similarity Search (Tue, Sep 19th, 12:30-16:15):** This session will focus on the application of UML to recommendation systems and similarity search. Students will learn about the different types of recommendation systems, and they will explore how UML can be used to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.
- **Building Recommender Systems with Gradio (Tue, Sep 19th, 16:30-18:15):** This session will be a hands-on workshop where students will build their own recommender systems using the Gradio interface and UML methods. Students will work in teams to create a recommender system for a real-world problem.
- **Introduction to Clustering: K-means & Hierarchical Approaches (Wed, Sep 20th, 08:15-12:00):** This session will introduce the principles and applications of clustering. Students will learn about the different types of clustering problems, and they will explore some of the most popular clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering.
- **UML Clustering Group Exercise (Wed, Sep 20th, 12:30-14:15):** This session will be a hands-on exercise where students will cluster a real-world dataset using UML methods. Students will work in teams to identify the optimal number of clusters for the dataset, and they will analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
