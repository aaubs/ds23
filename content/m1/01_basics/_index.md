This chapter is a basic introduction to statistical programming as well as a short brush-up on data more generally. In addition, we will have some statistics refreshers, reviewing important concepts. For some, this will be "old news", but many will certainly benefit from reviewing this material. Afterwards, we introduces some fundamental concepts of data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
