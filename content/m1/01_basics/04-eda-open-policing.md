In this workshop we are going to explore 2 things. More advanced EDA as well as working with internet data.

## EDA - Open Policing Project

In this workshop we are going to work with the Open Policing Dataset. Below you will find the starter notebook where this dataset (Rhode Island) is explored. You can check out some of the research based on this data ont the projectâ€™s page.

In this tutorial we will look into JSON, the probably most common datatype on the internet today and how we can work with it.
For the tutorial you will either need to install a local copy of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or make a free-tier account with [Atlas (MongoDB Cloud version)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).
