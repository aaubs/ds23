In this workshop we are going to learn about recommender systems as a type of UML.
Such systems are probably the most widely used and commercialy valuable form of AI today. Specifically we will be looking into collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.

## Plan for today
* Collaborative filtering / SVD recommender using Nomadlist Trips-data in a Notebooks
* Streamlit recommender-app

## Notebook(s)
* [{{< awesome fas fa-laptop-code >}} Uncommented code-snippet notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aaubs/ds-master/blob/main/notebooks/M1-recommender-nomadlis.ipynb)

## App
* [source code for the app](/ds22/apps/nomadrecommender.zip)
* [deployed recommender app](https://rjuro-streamlit-nomad-recommender-app-recommender-b2qt3y.streamlitapp.com/)

## Recommended Readings and resources
* This excellent [PyData Talk](https://youtu.be/EgE0DUrYmo8) by the developer of LightFM
