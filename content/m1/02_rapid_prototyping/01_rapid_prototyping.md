This session will cover the basics of rapid prototyping in data science, with a focus on the Streamlit and Gradio libraries. Students will learn how to use these libraries to create interactive web applications that can be used to explore data and test hypotheses.

* Prototyping Foundations: Grasp why rapid prototyping is essential in Data Science and its role in iterative development and deployment.
* Streamlit Introduction: Dive into Streamlit, a Python library that makes it easy to turn data scripts into interactive web applications.
* Gradio Exploration: Learn about Gradio, an interface library for quickly creating demos and UIs for machine learning models.
