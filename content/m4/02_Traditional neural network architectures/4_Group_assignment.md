# Portfolio Exercise 2: 

## Introduction

## Task 


* Build, train, and evaluate 2 special types of networks neural network with Pytorch. 
  1. A CNN for a spatial prediction problem
  2. A RNN or LSTM for a sequential problem
* Experiment with at least 2 different variations of hyperparameters for each network.
* Optional: Use gradio to build a simple interactive demo (in the notebook).

This should include:

1. Feature selection and/or engineering (if necessary)
3. SPreprocessing (if necessary)
4. Train-test split.
5. Defining a neural network architecture in putorch
6. Define a training loop. 
7. training the model.
8. Try out different hyperparameters. 
9. Evaluate the final model on the test data.
10. Visualize results with Grad.io


## Data

* 2 self choosen datasets not used in M4 so far.
* One dataset on image or other spatial data, eg. the classical [MNIST dataset](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html)
* One dataset on timeseries from last semesters [M1 timeseries forecast part](https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m1/03_sml/02-sml-ts/), or [M2 text classification](https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m2/02_nlp/1-nlp-intro-sml/).

## Delivery

* Create a github repository (or use the existing one and adapt it)
* Save colab notebook in the github.
* Provide a readme.md with brief description.
* Submission can be in groups up to 3.
* Submit by sending an email with link to repo to Hamid (hamidb@business.aau.dk) with Daniel & Roman in cc. (dsh@..., roman@...)
