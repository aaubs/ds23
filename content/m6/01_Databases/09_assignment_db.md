# Portfolio Exercise Databases: 

## Introduction

* Now it is time to get some coding done again :)
* This will be our first portfolio exercise,where you can practice your new skills.

## Task 

* Develop a Proof-of-Concept version of an application that is querying a database to come provide an output to the user.
* This can be for example:
  * Selecting observations from database, performing prediction with a (beforehand fitted) SML model.
  * Perform a UML procedure on observations queried from a database.
  * Perform a semantic/similarity search for an user input, retrieve most similar docs from a database.
* The data used should be non-trivial (eg.: enough observations,Â´maybe multiple tables, different types of data...)
* The solution has to be self-contained. This can be done:
  * Within a colab using for grad.io. (Hint: An option is to save the database on github, and then load it in the colab).)
  * As a streamlit app (figure out how to make it self-contained).
  * ... (sky is the limit.)

**Possible databases:**
* SQL DB (eg. SQL-lite)
* NoSQL DB 
  * Document (eg. tinyDB)
  * Vector (Eg. Faiss, Chroma)

## Delivery

* Create a github repository (or use the existing one and adapt it)
* Provide a readme.md with brief description.
* Submission can be in groups up to 3.
* Deadline 24/3.
* Submit by sending an email with link to repo to Hamid (hamidb@business.aau.dk) with Daniel & Roman in cc. (dsh@..., roman@...)
