This course is designed to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively implement MLOps and deployment practices in a business or industry setting. Students will learn about different types of databases and how to use them in ML projects, techniques for processing large datasets using Big Data workflows, and how to build and deploy APIs for machine learning models. These skills are essential for businesses that rely on machine learning to improve their products or services, such as a retail company using machine learning to personalize customer recommendations or a healthcare organization using machine learning to improve patient diagnosis and treatment.


Students will also learn about using modern tooling for experiment tracking, packaging and deploying machine learning models, and setting up pipelines for continuous integration and deployment. These tools are critical for ensuring the quality and reliability of machine learning models in production environments. By the end of the course, students will be able to confidently apply these techniques to improve the speed and reliability of their machine learning projects.


Course lectures will be complemented by a number of guest presentations with industry examples how MLOps technologies are used in different businesses.
