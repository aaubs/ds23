## Presentation format
Students will deliver 20-25 minute presentations on AI, safety, and ethics, inspired by assigned documents. They will also develop 2-3 questions or interactive formats for class engagement. Topics include politics and safety, planning for AGI, and issues like bias, toxicity, and misinformation in large language models. Presentations may be published on a GitHub page with accompanying blog posts.
