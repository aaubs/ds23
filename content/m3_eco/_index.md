## M4 - Applied Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence

> **Note:** M3 - Final Assignment Deadline: Monday, 8 January 2024, 12:00 PM

This course offers an applied introduction to deep learning tailored for economics students. We will comprehensively cover the fundamentals of deep learning, including its foundational concepts, tensors, typical architectures, and real-world applications within economics. Additionally, we will delve into various training paradigms and tools commonly employed in the field of deep learning.
In the initial segment of the course, our focus will be on traditional neural network architectures, encompassing artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Through these models, we will explore their utility in addressing economic challenges, such as forecasting.
As the course progresses, students will be introduced to advanced topics like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformer models, and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. We will delve into the core concept of attention and its role in enhancing the performance of deep learning models. Practical insights will be shared regarding tools within the GNN libraries like PyG, the Transformer ecosystem involving libraries such as SBERT and Simpletransformers, and the GPT ecosystem, which includes LangChain, among others.
Throughout the duration of the course, practical applications of GNNs, Transformers, and GPT models in real-world economic scenarios, particularly in patent research including state-of-the-art patent searches, patent classification, etc., will be demonstrated. This will encompass the utilization of SBERT for sentence and image embeddings, fine-tuning, and inference techniques for popular transformer-based language models like BERT, question-answering systems, and text summarization.
The lectures will be enriched with real-world examples from the realm of economics. These examples will serve to illustrate the concepts and techniques covered during the course. By the course's culmination, students will have acquired a robust understanding of deep learning and its contemporary applications within the field of economics.
Students will be afforded numerous opportunities to collaborate in groups on four mini-projects. These projects will entail the practical application of concepts and techniques gleaned from the lectures to real-world economic research scenarios. The primary objective of these projects is to provide students with hands-on experience in utilizing deep learning, enabling them to construct a portfolio that showcases their acquired skills. By the course's conclusion, each student will have curated a collection of four mini-projects, exemplifying their adeptness in applying deep learning to tackle economics research problems.
