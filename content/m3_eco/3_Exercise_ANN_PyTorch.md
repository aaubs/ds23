> Swedish Committee on Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance. [read more](https://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/slr/frames/slr06.html)


### Overview

In the dataset:

* X = number of claims
* Y = total payment for all the claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor for geographical zones in Sweden

Reference: Swedish Committee on Analysis of Risk Premium in Motor Insurance

### Tasks

* First step: We will create a simple Artificial Neural Network with 1 node and training with 1 sample of data 
* Second step: The simple Artificial Neural Network will be trained through the dataset
