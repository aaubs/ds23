Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.\nM3: Data-Driven Business Modelling and Strategy 15 ECTS Course with integrated project in which you will learn how companies plan, prepare and execute data-driven projects. In the project you will work wich a company case and build a \u0026ldquo;mini\u0026rdquo; version of the product/process.\nFor Social Data Science Students - Elective Semester M3: (SDS) Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Analytics 5 ECTS\nIntroduces to the most recent developments in machine learning, which are deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The module will provide a solid foundation for this exciting and rapidly developing field. Students will learn whether and how to apply deep learning techniques for business analytics, and acquire proficiency in new methods autonomously.\nCapstone Project Semester project utilising techniques and approaches from SDS in the context of a problem related to your main study field.\n"},{"uri":"https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/info/04_litetrature/","title":"Literature &amp; Resources","tags":[],"description":"","content":"While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version. We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.\nMain Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using Python. We will frequently refer to selected chapters for further study. Documentation of the used packages, tutorials, papers, podcasts etc. will be added throughout.\nVanderPlas, J. (2016).

Convenient, unlimited, but a bit slow (Pyhton, r ). Instance based: UCloud: New cloud infrastructure provided by AAU, AU, SDU AAU Strato: AAU CLAUDIA infratructure. Very powerful, but access needs a bit of experience with working via terminal. Community Kaggle: Crowdsourced data science challanges.
