In this workshop we are going to learn about recommender systems as a type of UML. Such systems are probably the most widely used and commercialy valuable form of AI today. Specifically we will be looking into collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.

This session will be a hands-on workshop where students will build their own recommender systems using the Gradio interface and UML methods. Students will work in teams to create a recommender system for a real-world problem.
