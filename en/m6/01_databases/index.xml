In this lecture, we will provide brief examples how to populate and query SQL and NoSQL databases. We will also demonstrate how to use them in a ML workflow.

While TinyDB is a document-oriented database that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use with JSON-like structures, SQLite is a popular and lightweight SQL-based relational database management system.
Throughout this tutorial, we will explore the following topics:
Loading a CSV file into both TinyDB and SQLite Performing basic operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, in both databases Utilizing these databases for machine learning projects We will be using Python along with the TinyDB and SQLite libraries to accomplish these tasks.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio Assignment Databases</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/01_databases/09_assignment_db/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/01_databases/09_assignment_db/</guid><description>Portfolio Exercise Databases: Introduction Now it is time to get some coding done again :) This will be our first portfolio exercise,where you can practice your new skills. Task Develop a Proof-of-Concept version of an application that is querying a database to come provide an output to the user. This can be for example: Selecting observations from database, performing prediction with a (beforehand fitted) SML model. Perform a UML procedure on observations queried from a database.</description></item></channel></rss>
