It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging and sharing code, and deploying models.
MLflow provides a unified platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment. It helps to increase productivity, collaboration, and reproducibility in data science projects.
Here are the main components of MLflow:
Experiment Tracking: This component helps you to track your machine learning experiments by recording and visualizing metrics, parameters, and artifacts.</description></item><item><title>MLOps on AWS: a Hands-On Tutorial</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/04_mlops-with-mlflow/2_mlops_mlflow_aws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/04_mlops-with-mlflow/2_mlops_mlflow_aws/</guid><description> MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of automating the process of deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models. In this hands-on tutorial, we will walk you through the essential steps of implementing MLOps on AWS using MLflow.
This session will provide a hands-on project to reinforce your understanding and skills in working with MLflow on AWS in ML projects.

Use MLflow within one of your previous projects and save structured and unstructured information related to your trained model in SQLite within MLflow. Optionally, prepare a ML app based on three layers as Data, Business, Presentation Layers.
Introduction For this assignment, you will be using one of your previous projects to train a machine learning model and track and manage your machine learning experiments using MLflow.</description></item></channel></rss>
