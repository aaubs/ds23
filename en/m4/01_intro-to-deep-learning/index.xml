It should have minimum 2 hidden layers Experiment with at least 5 different variations of hyperparameters (n layers / neurons, activation function, epochs, optimizers, learning rate etc.). Use gradio to build a simple interactive demo (in the notebook). This should include:
Feature selection Feature engineering (if necessary) Standard ML preprocessing (if necessary) Train-test split. Defining a neural network architecture in putorch Define a training loop.</description></item></channel></rss>
