Chatbots are one of the most wide spread NLP applications. In this tutorial we will build a simple retrieval chatbot that can be used for example as an alternative for FAQ applications in companies.
The approach is following:
Train a model on variants of a question. Take input and predict the type of question asked - this is called &amp;ldquo;intent&amp;rdquo; Reply with a pre-defined response corresponding to the question asked.</description></item><item><title>SML - Further topics</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/03_sml/03-sml-addon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/03_sml/03-sml-addon/</guid><description>This session introduces adittional topics of intertest in SML

Word embeddings such as Word2Vec or fastText are probably the last techology in NLP before the deep learning revolution. Others would argue that they paved the way for DL becoming the NLP standard. May that as it be, it&amp;rsquo;s a powerfull approach and in this tutorial you will learn about the theory behind these word representations, how they are trained (also from disk). We will also explore approaches to representing text using pretrained vectors.</description></item><item><title>NW Cases</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m2/01_networks/4-tutorials-elites-eu-ai-companies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m2/01_networks/4-tutorials-elites-eu-ai-companies/</guid><description>Danish Power Elites Many people dream of being one of them, but only few make it all the way to the top.

The reason behind the framework&amp;rsquo;s success is the ease with which it allows data scientists to build data-driven web apps without the need to deal with frontend development or other dev-ops stuff while allowing them to incorporate all kinds of functions going far beyond just dashboards. Going from a Jupyter Notebook to a Streamlit app just requires adding a few lines of code and rewriting a few minor things.</description></item><item><title>Mathematics (Brushup)</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/01_basics/07-math/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/01_basics/07-math/</guid><description>How does Math help us? Machines can only understand numbers. For instance, to perform ML algorithms on text and multimedia, they need to be stored in vectors, matrices, and tensors. An example would be the representation of text as a vector of 768 dimensions. Using linear algebra, you can manipulate vectors, matrices, and tensors.
We will focus on understanding the mathematics behind ML algorithms in two dimensions. This tutorial will provide you with an overview of how machine learning algorithms work when applied to higher-dimensional data.</description></item><item><title>Portfolio Assignment Databases</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/01_databases/09_assignment_db/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m6/01_databases/09_assignment_db/</guid><description>Portfolio Exercise Databases: Introduction Now it is time to get some coding done again :) This will be our first portfolio exercise,where you can practice your new skills.
