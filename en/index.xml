We will cover the Python data science stack, essential tools and platforms, software setup, semester overview, and Python 101.
Session 1: Welcome Students! This session sets the stage for your data science journey:
Python Data Science Stack: Dive into Python&amp;rsquo;s core data science libraries and frameworks. We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered!
Ecosystem Deep Dive: Familiarize yourself with essential tools and platforms, such as Github, UCloud, Google Colab, and Jupyter.</description></item><item><title>- Data Handeling and Manipulation</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/01_intro_ds/02_data_handeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/m1/01_intro_ds/02_data_handeling/</guid><description>This session will introduce students to the foundational aspects of data handling in Python. Students will learn about the different types of data that are important in data science, and they will explore essential operations like arrange, group-by, filter, select, and join. By the end of this session, students should have a solid understanding of primary data manipulation techniques, setting the stage for more advanced subjects.

This module will prove a condensed introduction to the “Data Science Pipeline”, introducing students to methods, techniques, and workflows in applied data analytics and machine learning, including data acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization, and communication.
M2: Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing 5 ECTS
Focuses on analyzing a variety of unstructured data sources. Particularly, students will learn how to explore, analyze, and visualize natural language (text) as well as relational (network) data.</description></item><item><title>Literature &amp; Resources</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/info/04_litetrature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/info/04_litetrature/</guid><description>While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version. We generally recommend you to use these amazing resources for problem-solving and further self-study on the topic.
Main Literature These pieces of work can be seen as main references for data science using Python.</description></item><item><title>Semester Schedule</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/info/03_schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds23/en/info/03_schedule/</guid><description>This will be shortly updated with additional key dates and topics for the semester.
