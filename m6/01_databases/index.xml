While TinyDB is a document-oriented database that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use with JSON-like structures, SQLite is a popular and lightweight SQL-based relational database management system.
Throughout this tutorial, we will explore the following topics:
Loading a CSV file into both TinyDB and SQLite Performing basic operations, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, in both databases We will be using Python along with the TinyDB and SQLite libraries to accomplish these tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
