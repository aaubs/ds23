This can pose a significant challenge for traditional data processing tools and techniques. Fortunately, there are a variety of Big Data processing engines available today that are designed to handle these challenges, such as Apache Spark and Polars. Spark is a powerful Big Data processing engine that allows you to work with large datasets in ML projects.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 2: Performing a Big Data workflow with Spark and Polars</title><link>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/02_big-data-workflows/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m6/02_big-data-workflows/2_exercise_bigdata_workflow/</guid><description>In this session, we will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark, a powerful Big Data processing engine, for processing large datasets in ML projects. The session will cover tasks such as setting up a Spark environment, reading and writing data, and performing transformations and aggregations on data. Additionally, we will also introduce Polars, a similar data manipulation library for Rust, and compare its features to those of Spark.
This session will provide hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding and skills in working with Spark and Polars for processing big data in ML projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
