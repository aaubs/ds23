Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language. In Proceedings of the international AAAI conference on web and social media (Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 512-515).\nYou are given a collection of approximately 25k tweets that have been manually (human) annotated. class denotes: 0 - hate speech, 1 - offensive language, 2 - neither\nhttps://github.com/SDS-AAU/SDS-master/raw/master/M2/data/twitter_hate.zip\n1. Preprocessing and vectorizaion. Justify your choices and explain possible alternatives (e.g. removing stopwords, identifying bi/tri-grams, removing verbs or use of stemming, lemmatization etc.)\nCreate a bag-of-words representation, apply TF-IDF and dimensionality reduction (LSA-topic modelling alternatively simply PCA or SVD) to transform your corpus into a feature matrix. 2. Explore and compare the 2 \u0026ldquo;classes of interest\u0026rdquo; - hate speech vs offensive language. Can you see differences by using simple count-based approaches? Can you identify themes (aka clusters / topics) that are specific for one class or another? Explore them using, e.g. simple crosstabs - topic vs. class and to get more detailed insights within-cluster top (TF-IDF) terms. (This step requires preprocessed/tokenized inputs). 3. Build an ML model that can predict hate speech Use the ML pipeline (learned in M1) to build a classification model that can identify offensive language and hate speech. It is not an easy task to get good results. Experiment with different models on the two types of text-representations that you create in 2.\nBonus: Explore missclassified hate speech tweets vs those correctly predicted. Can you find specific patterns? Can you observe some topics that are more prevalent in those that the model identifies correcly?\nThe best-reported results for this dataset are.\nClass Precision 0 0.61 1 0.91 2 0.95 Overall 0.91 Notebook This notebook contains an extended solution.\nHate Speech Detection Context - Exercise: Presidential Debate 2020 Yes, we are going back in time to the Presidential Debate in the US 2020 - the time of lots of unhappy Tweeting.

Background Let the fun begin. You will analyze network datacollected from the managers of a high-tec company. This dataset, originating from the paper below, is widely used in research on organizational networks. Time to give it a shot as well. Krackhardt D. (1987). Cognitive social structures. Social Networks, 9, 104-134. The company manufactured high-tech equipment on the west coast of the United States and had just over 100 employees with 21 managers. Each manager was asked to whom do you go to for advice and who is your friend, to whom do you report was taken from company documents. Description\nThe dataset includes 4 files - 3xKrack-High-Tec and 1x High-Tec-Attributes. Krack-High-Tec includes the following three 21x3 text matrices:\nADVICE, directed, binary FRIENDSHIP, directed, binary REPORTS_TO, directed, binary Column 1 contains the ID of the ego (from where the edge starts), and column 2 the alter (to which the edge goes). Column 3 indicates the presence (=1) or absence (=0) of an edge.\nHigh-Tec-Attributes includes one 21x4 valued matrix.\nID: Numeric ID of the manager AGE: The managers age (in years) TENURE: The length of service or tenure (in years) LEVEL: The level in the corporate hierarchy (coded 1,2 and 3; 1 = CEO, 2 = Vice President, 3 = manager) DEPT: The department (coded 1,2,3,4 with the CEO in department 0, ie not in a department) Tasks 1.

As the world\u0026rsquo;s largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to be the major representation of the United States\u0026rsquo; second wave of coffee culture. As of September 2020, the company had 32,660 stores in 83 countries, including 16,637 company operated stores and 16,023 licensed stores. Of these 32,660 stores, 18,354 were in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Starbucks locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso, caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Depending on the country, most locations offer free Wi-Fi. Headquartered in the Starbucks Center, the company was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle\u0026rsquo;s Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan, Italy – decided to make the coffee bean store a coffeeshop serving espresso-based drinks. While chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz\u0026rsquo;s first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States (Content from Wikipedia).\nTasks First step: We will create RNNs and LSTMs Second step: RNNs and LSTMs will be trained through the dataset Notebooks Here you will find the notebooks for this session:\nImplementing RNNs using PyTorch Implementing RNNs using PyTorch - Exercise Implementing LSTMs using PyTorch Implementing LSTMs using PyTorch - Exercise Implementing LSTMs using PyTorch - Solution Implementing LSTMs using PyTorch - Text Generation Implementing LSTMs using PyTorch - Text Generation with embeddings layer Resources PyTorch PyTorch NN Linear "},{"uri":"https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m4/03_intro-to-transformer-models/3_exercise-session-3_pytorch/","title":"Exercise Session 3","tags":[],"description":"","content":"In this session, you will learn how to finetune SBERT embeddings and use them in downstream tasks.

First, you will learn how to properly upload your model to the HuggingFace Hub, a platform that allows you to easily share and access models. Then, you will learn how to use Streamlit and Gradio, two user-friendly platforms, to deploy your model and make it accessible to others. By the end of this session, you will be able to confidently upload and deploy your models for use by others.\nHow to upload your fine-tuned model on HuggingFace First, it logs in to the Hugging Face Hub using notebook_login(), which allows for easy uploading and access to Hugging Face models.\n#Importing the necessary libraries from huggingface_hub import notebook_login from transformers import pipeline #Login to Hugging Face account from the Jupyter notebook notebook_login() Next, it pushes the trainer object, model object, and dataset object to the Hub using their push_to_hub() methods. This uploads these objects to the Hub for others to use and access.\n#Pushing the trained model, trainer and dataset to the Hugging Face Hub trainer.push_to_hub(\u0026#39;Your Fine-Tuned HuggingFace Model\u0026#39;) model.push_to_hub(\u0026#39;Your Fine-Tuned HuggingFace Model\u0026#39;) dataset.push_to_hub(\u0026#39;Your Fine-Tuned HuggingFace Model\u0026#39;) Finally, the code loads a pre-trained Danish emotion classification model using model_ckpt = \u0026lsquo;Your Fine-Tuned HuggingFace Model\u0026rsquo;, and creates a pipeline using the pipeline() method from the transformers library. This pipeline can then be used to classify text inputs into one of several emotional categories.\n#Defining the path to the trained model checkpoint on the Hugging Face Hub model_ckpt = \u0026#39;Your Fine-Tuned HuggingFace Model\u0026#39; #Creating a pipeline for example text classification using the fine-tuned model from the Hugging Face Hub pipe = pipeline(\u0026#39;text-classification\u0026#39;, model=model_ckpt) #Passing the Danish text examples to the pipeline and getting the predicted labels pipe([\u0026#39;Du er en idiot!\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Jeg er sulten!\u0026#39;]) How to deploy your fine-tuned model on HuggingFace You can also deploy your fine-tuned Hugging Face model on Streamlit through the Hugging Face web interface. Here are the steps to do so:\nAfter uploading your fine-tuned Hugging Face model on the Hugging Face Model Hub, create a new space in your Hugging Face profile and enter the details for your app, including the name of your application. Select \u0026ldquo;Streamlit\u0026rdquo; (or Gradio) as the deployment type. click \u0026ldquo;New space\u0026rdquo;. Upload your app.py and requirements.txt files to the Hugging Face web interface. Your app is automatically deployed. That\u0026rsquo;s it! Your fine-tuned Hugging Face model is now deployed on Streamlit through the Hugging Face web interface and can be accessed using your app.\nTwo Simple Examples for Deploying an App using Gradio and Streamlit 1.

We will cover the basics of deep learning, including its foundations, tensors, typical architectures, and applications. We will also discuss the different training paradigms and tooling used in deep learning.\nIn the first half of the course, we will focus on different classical neural network architectures, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In the second half of the course, we will introduce students to transformer models, the core idea of attention, and milestone transformer architectures. We will also cover the tooling used in the transformer ecosystem, including libraries like sbert, transformers, and simpletransformers.\nThroughout the course, we will apply transformers to real-world business problems. This will include using sbert for sentence and image embedding, finetuning and inference of common transformer-based language models like BERT, and training timeseries transformers for time-sensitive business applications.\nLikewise, we will use real-world business examples to illustrate the concepts and techniques covered in the lectures. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of deep learning and its current applications in business. We will have frequent opportunities to work in groups on four mini-projects. These projects will involve applying the concepts and techniques learned in the lectures to real-world business examples. The goal of these projects is to give you hands-on experience with deep learning and help them build a portfolio of work to showcase your skills..\nContent for this module Part 1: Intro to Deep Learning Part 2: Traditional neural network architectures Part 3: Intro to transformer models Part 4: Training and publishing transformer models "},{"uri":"https://aaubs.github.io/ds22/m5/","title":"Data Governance and Ethics","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\nThis module explores ethical, legal, and policy aspects of data use in business, covering law, privacy, bias, and fairness.

Roman x Stable Diffusion\nIn this hackathon, you will be using everything you have learned so far (and some things still coming up next week) to create a striking and informative dashboard. The winning group will receive an even more amazing prize!\nWhat to do? In groups, find an exciting dataset of similar complexity as the ones we worked with in class (e.g. comparable to Open Policing, Airbnb). You can find them, for instance, on Kaggle.\nConsider also:\nhttps://github.com/shreyashankar/datasets-for-good https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets Steps for the analysis\nPerform EDA and answer interesting questions about the data. You can use geospatial analysis (if you like). You do not have to scrape or generate data, but you can. Perform analyses first in a notebook and generate all relevant calculations and plots there. On Sept. 13th, we\u0026rsquo;ll introduce you to Streamlit, a framework for webapp development. You are obviously welcome to look into it on your own before that. The submission deadline will be on the 15th (noon) - as a deployed (accessible online) web app. You will pitch your dashboard in class. We will forward all submitted apps to an expert jury for evaluation. The winning team will be announced in the week between 19. and 23. September. 🎉\nThe Jury Mathias Boe Flinta CTO at Scandinavian Medical Solutions\nMathias is Head of Data \u0026amp; Analytics \u0026amp; IT at SMS (Scandinavian Medical Solutions). He finished his studies in cand.oecon. (MSc. Economics) one year ago, during which he specialized in BI and Data Science. Currently, he is implementing a new ERP system, which will set a good foundation for BI analysis and predictive foresting with Data Science within the coming year.\nKarolina Grodzinska Data Analyst Co-op @ Schneider Electric, Boston US\nKarolina currently works as a data analyst at Schneider Electric.

The reason behind the framework\u0026rsquo;s success is the ease with which it allows data scientists to build data-driven web apps without the need to deal with frontend development or other dev-ops stuff while allowing them to incorporate all kinds of functions going far beyond just dashboards. Going from a Jupyter Notebook to a Streamlit app just requires adding a few lines of code and rewriting a few minor things.\nFrom ipynb to web-app In this tutorial, we will be going back to this Airbnb EDA Notebook from last week and building a little web-app from it.\nPlan of attack\nWe will isolate the data-prep and visualization parts we are interested in Build \u0026amp; test the app in uCloud Deploy the app via GitHub to the Streamlit Cloud (this step is optional, as you can also deploy via uCloud - ~2kr/day server costs) uCloud is a uninversity cloud service. You get 1000 DKK and 50GB storage to start with but you can apply for more. This is usually granted, as the service is not used a lot. It\u0026rsquo;s a great place to learn about modern platforms, infrastructure and more. You can play with different types of installations in a safe environment. You can also request very powerful machines.\nUCloud Set-up For this project you will need 2 app-containers running: Coder-python and Streamlit. Both can run with minimal CPU/RAM requirements. Streamlit can only run once you created a project in Code-python and saved an app.py file. It is a good idea, to create a public link and connect it to the streamlit-app. Thus, you can try out your app on your phone or share it. Saving changes in app.py will trigger imediate recomplies and your app will update everywhere.\nStreamlit syntax and layout Now, what do we need to turn our notebook into a web app?\n# 1. page-config st.set_page_config(page_title=\u0026#39;Streamlit - Dashboard 🤯\u0026#39;, page_icon=\u0026#34;🚀\u0026#34;, layout=\u0026#39;wide\u0026#39; ) # 2. Page layout - e.g. a title st.title(\u0026#34;AirBnb rentals in Copenhagen 🇩🇰\u0026#34;) Streamlit layout follows your script - things that come first, will be displayed first\u0026hellip;etc.\nLoading and preprocessing the data We can just proceed as in a notebook, but it is useful to rewrite the data loading and preprocessing into a function and add the @st.experimental_singleton decorator. Streamlit performs a re-run every time something is chaged (UI) by the user e.g. a new filter is set. To reduce processing time it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea not to re-run data-loading every single time.\n# LOAD DATA ONLY ONCE @st.experimental_singleton def load_data(): data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;http://data.insideairbnb.com/denmark/hovedstaden/copenhagen/2022-06-24/visualisations/listings.csv\u0026#39;) # also preprocess as we did in the notebook data = data[data.number_of_reviews \u0026gt; 0] data = data[data.room_type.isin([\u0026#39;Private room\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Entire home/apt\u0026#39;])] data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;] = (data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] - data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;].mean())/data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;].std(ddof=0) data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;] = data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;].abs() data = data[data.price_z \u0026lt; 3] data[\u0026#39;log_price\u0026#39;] = np.log(data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;]) return data # LOAD THE DATA NOW! data = load_data() The plots to be rendered We will go for 2 plots.

Altair doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to process beyond 5000 observations. That means that you have two options. Either you limit your data, as we will do here, or you pre-computed things in e.g. pandas. Here we will use 2 simple if-statements to make sure that data is always max 5000 observations.\nif len(data) \u0026gt; 5000: data_alt = data.sample(5000) if len(data) \u0026lt;= 5000: data_alt = data We use altair to create a bar chart and let it calculate the mean of the price variable (x-axis) with y and colours being split by the room type. We spread the chart across rows that represent neighbourhoods. Also, we add a tooltip that displays the values for the individual bars. We set strokeWidth to 0 to make things a bit tidier.\nprice_chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode( x=\u0026#39;mean(price):Q\u0026#39;, y=alt.Y(\u0026#39;room_type:O\u0026#39;,axis=alt.Axis(labels=False), title=\u0026#34; \u0026#34;), color=alt.Color(\u0026#39;room_type:N\u0026#39;, scale=alt.Scale(scheme=\u0026#39;lightorange\u0026#39;)), row=\u0026#39;neighbourhood:N\u0026#39;, tooltip=[\u0026#34;neighbourhood:N\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mean(price):Q\u0026#34;] ).configure_view(strokeWidth=0).interactive() Introductin UI / Filters We\u0026rsquo;ll introduce 2 filters in the main page (you could also move them to the sidebar): price range and neighbourhood. As you can see below, the st.sliderand st.multiselect produce python objects (tuple and list) that we can use to filter our data DataFrame with plain Pandas. e.g. When only 3 neighbourhoods are selected neighbourhood_select will turn a list of 3 elements and data[data.neighbourhood.isin(neighbourhood_select)] will result in a dataframe where only listings from these areas are present.\n#filter for price-range price_selected = st.slider(\u0026#34;Select price range\u0026#34;, min_value = int(data.price.min()), max_value= int(data.price.max()), value = (300,3000), step=50) data = data[(data.price \u0026gt; price_selected[0]) \u0026amp; (data.price \u0026lt; price_selected[1])] #filter for neighborhoods neighbourhood_select = st.multiselect(\u0026#39;Select neighbourhoods\u0026#39;, data.neighbourhood.unique(), data.neighbourhood.unique()) data = data[data.neighbourhood.isin(neighbourhood_select)] Rendering the visualizations So far nothing is displayed. We only created the objects r(pydeck map) and price_chart altair chart. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you how you like to handle it. I find it a bit easier to separate compute and render parts. Here we are going to add a horizontal column split (to make things a bit more pretty). We split the screen into 5 parts, where the first gets 3 and the second 2. To display our chats, we use the streamlit functions st.pydeck_chart and st.altair_chart. You will find many more options in the streamlit documentation.\nrow1_1, row1_2 = st.columns((3, 2)) with row1_1: st.pydeck_chart(r) with row1_2: st.altair_chart(price_chart, use_container_width=False) Requirements Our imports for that project look like this:\nimport streamlit as st import streamlit.components.v1 as components import pydeck as pdk import numpy as np import pandas as pd import altair as alt alt.renderers.set_embed_options(theme=\u0026#39;dark\u0026#39;) In contrast to a notebook, we cannot really install packages on the fly. Considering a simple python deployment environment, we need to specify what packages (aside from streamlit) need to be installed so that the app can run. This is often done by adding a requirements.txt file to the project folder. We add all libraries that we loaded just to be sure. This is not always the best idea, as things can clash\u0026hellip; but that is a chapter of its own to be covered at a later point. 😵\npydeck altair numpy pandas All code in one place requirements.txt Expand to see code... pydeck numpy pandas altair app.py Expand to see code... #imports import streamlit as st import streamlit.components.v1 as components import pydeck as pdk import numpy as np import pandas as pd import altair as alt alt.renderers.set_embed_options(theme=\u0026#39;dark\u0026#39;) # page config st.set_page_config(page_title=\u0026#39;Streamlit - Dashboard 🤯\u0026#39;, page_icon=\u0026#34;🚀\u0026#34;, layout=\u0026#39;wide\u0026#39; ) #load data @st.experimental_singleton def load_data(): data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;http://data.insideairbnb.com/denmark/hovedstaden/copenhagen/2022-06-24/visualisations/listings.csv\u0026#39;) data = data[data.number_of_reviews \u0026gt; 0] data = data[data.room_type.isin([\u0026#39;Private room\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Entire home/apt\u0026#39;])] data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;] = (data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;] -data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;].mean())/data[\u0026#39;price\u0026#39;].std(ddof=0) data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;] = data[\u0026#39;price_z\u0026#39;].abs() data = data[data.price_z \u0026lt; 3] return data data = load_data() # 2.
